Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcom?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
false thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures:
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.

\*SERVANT enters.\*

* MACBETH: The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose look?

    SERVANT: There is ten thousand--

    ** MACBETH: Geese, villain!
    
        SERVANT: Soldiers, sir.
        
        *** MACBETH: Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
        Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
        Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine
        Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?
        
            SERVANT: The English force, so please you.
            
            **** MACBETH: Take thy face hence.

                Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
                When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
                Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
                I have lived long enough: my way of life
                Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
                And that which should accompany old age,
                As honour, love, obedience, troops of fiends,
                I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
                Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,
                Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!
                
                \*SEYTON enters.\*
                
                SEYTON: What is your gracious pleasure?
                
                ***** MACBETH: What news more?
                
                    SEYTON: All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
                    
                    ****** MACBETH: I'll fight 'til my bones my flesh be hack'd.
                        Give me my armour.
                        
                        SEYTON: 'Tis not needed yet.
                        
                        ******* MACBETH: I'll put it on.
                        Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
                        Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
                        How does your patient, doctor?
                        
                            DOCTOR: Not so sick my lord,
                            As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
                            That keep her from her rest.
                            
                            ******** MACBETH: Cure her of that.
                                Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
                                Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
                                Raze out the written troubles of the brain
                                And with some sweet oblivious antidote
                                Cleans the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
                                Which weighs upon the heart?
                            
                                DOCTOR: Therein the patient
                                Must minister to himself.
                                
                                ********* MACBETH: Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
                                    Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
                                    Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
                                    Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
                                    The water of my land, find her disease,
                                    And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
                                    I would applaud thee to the very echo,
                                    That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
                                    What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
                                    Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?
                                    
                                    DOCTOR: Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
                                    Makes us hear something.
                                    
                                    ********** MACBETH: Bring it after me.
                                    I will not be afraid of death and bane,
                                    Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.
                                    
                                        DOCTOR (Aside): Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
                                        Profit again should hardly draw me here.

The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up:
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.

\*A cry comes from within the castle.\*

* MACBETH: What is that noise?

    SEYTON: It is the cry of women, my good lord.
    
    \*SEYTON exits.\*
    
    ** MACBETH: I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
        The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
        To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
        Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
        As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
        Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
        Cannot once start me.
        
        \*SEYTON enters.\*
        
        *** MACBETH: Wherefore was that cry?
        
            SEYTON: The queen my lord, is dead.
            
            **** MACBETH: She should have died hereafter;
                There would have been a time for such a word.
                To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
                Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
                To the last syllable of recorded time,
                And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
                The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
                Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
                That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
                And then is heard no more: it is a tale
                Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
                Signifying nothing.
            
                \*MESSENGER enters.\*
                
                MESSENGER: Gracious my lord,
                I should report that which I say I saw,
                But know not how to do it.
                    
                ***** MACBETH: Well, say, sir.
                    MESSENGER: As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
                    I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
                    The wood began to move.
                    
                    ****** MACBETH: Liar and slave!
                    
                        MESSENGER: Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
                        Within this three mile may you see it coming;
                        I say, a moving grove.
                        
                        ******* MACBETH: If thou speak'st false,
                            Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
                            Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
                            I care not if thou dost for me as much.
                            I pull in resolution, and begin
                            To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
                            That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
                            Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
                            Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
                            If this which he avouches does appear,
                            There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
                            I gin to be aweary of the sun,
                            And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
                            Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
                            At least we'll die with harness on our back.
                            
                            \*MACBETH, SEYTON, MESSENGER, and SOLDIERS.\*
