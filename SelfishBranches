\*SEYTON\* peers out from stage right.

SEYTON (Whispering): AHEM! Bring me no reports; let them fly all.

* MACBETH: What was that?
    SEYTON (Loudly Whispering): Bring me no reports! Let them fly all!
    ** MACBETH (Shouting): WHAT?
        SEYTON (Shouting): BRING ME NO REPORTS! LET THEM FLY ALL!
        *** MACBETH: Hey, keep it down!
            SEYTON (Shouting): HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ACTOR STRANGLE SOMEONE BEFORE?
            
            \*SEYTON turns to look offstage.\*
            
            SEYTON: What? WHAT? Macbeth started it!
            
            \*SERVANT clears their throat.\*
            
            SERVANT: There is ten thousand--
            
            **** MACBETH: Ten thousand what?
                SERVANT: Geese. Wait, no... err...
                
                ***** MACBETH: Ten thousand geese?
                    SERVANT: No. Soldiers, sir!
                    ****** MACBETH: Is that how many soldiers I have?
                        SERVANT: Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
                        
                        ******* MACBETH: What did you just say to me?
                            SERVANT: Wait! WAIT! The English force, so please you.
                            
                            \*SEYTON enters from stage right, slowly clapping.\*
                            
                            SEYTON: Congrats, congrats! I have your armour here Sire, and LOOK, MACDUFF!
                            \*MACBETH, SEYTON, DOCTOR, and SERVANT exit.\*
                        ******* MACBETH: My fear hath never been red.
                            SERVANT: Wait, wait, that's err... that's wrong.

                            DOCTOR: Ha, your royal preparation is ready! Let us go!

                        \*There is an uncomfortable silence as the SERVANT and MACBETH stare at each other for quite some time.\*
                        
                        DOCTOR: Ha, I am going to... leave now. And MACBETH will come with me to... check on things.

                    DOCTOR: Ha, yes! She is troubled with thick coming fancies,
                    That keep her from her rest.
                    
                    ****** MACBETH: Whatever you said makes no sense.
                        DOCTOR: Ha, very good. My good lord! Ha, your... royal preparation
                        Makes us hear something.
                        
                        *******[MACBETH: I still am not making any sense of what you're saying.]

                        MACBETH: I--
                        
                        DOCTOR: HA YES, VERY GOOD! WERE I FROM DUNSINANE! I mean...
                        
                        DOCTOR (Aside): Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
                        Profit again should hardly draw me here.
                        
                        \*DOCTOR rushes over to MACBETH to force them both offstage. SERVANT follows.\*
            
            **** \*MACBETH pauses to look at the SERVANT\*
                SERVANT: What are you... doing?
                
                ***** \*MACBETH continues to stare.\*

                            PLAY DIRECTOR: Sure, let's go with that.
                            
                            \*The PLAY DIRECTOR waits for a few seconds.\*
                            
                            PLAY DIRECTOR: AND so, MACBETH went offstage to... deal with the SERVANT!

                            PLAY DIRECTOR: What? No!

                        DOCTOR: I think sire Macbeth wishes no company. Let us depart.
                        
                        \*SERVANT exits. DOCTOR is about to exit, and turns to face MACBETH. MACBETH stares at DOCTOR silently.\*
                        
                        DOCTOR: Seyton shall be with your armour, lord. Ha, I shall do my best to cure my patient.
                        
                        \*The DOCTOR tugs MACBETH offstage.\*
                ***** MACBETH: I don't know.

                    FAKE MACBETH: Alright, I'm gonna have a go. Excuse me, excuse me.
                    
                    \*MACBETH is hurriedly escorted offstage. FAKE MACBETH performs the rest of the scene, and exits with DOCTOR and SERVANT.\*
            **** MACBETH: Don't think we're not done, Seyton.
                SEYTON (Shouting): MACBETH! KEEP YOUR FLYING TRAP SHUT! THIS IS THE LAST STRAW!
                        
                    \*SEYTON marches on stage. PLAY DIRECTOR follows.\*
                    
                    PLAY DIRECTOR: Look, please don't make a scene...
                    
                    SEYTON: Oh, oh, I'M NOT MAKING A SCENE? WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?
                    
                    \*SEYTON gestures wildly at MACBETH.\*

                \*MACBETH begins to bow, and exits.\*
            **** MACBETH: Next line?
                SEYTON (Shouting): TILL BIRNAM WOOD REMOVE TO DUNSINANE,

    ** MACBETH: I mean, I can't understand what you're saying.
        SEYTON (Whispering): It means Macbeth doesn't want to hear any bad news.
        *** MACBETH: I get that, but... wait, why doesn't Macbeth want to hear any bad news?
                SEYTON (No longer whispering): Because he killed King Duncan, and he's now regretting the consequences of his actions!
                **** MACBETH: Wait, Macbeth's a murderer?
                    \*SEYTON steps onto the stage, and approaches MACBETH.\*

                        SEYTON: I mean, here I am, I showed up on time. To the play. The play that you're supposed to show up on time for.
                        
                        \*SEYTON pauses.\*
                        
                        SEYTON: The play that you're late for. And you don't know your lines. "That's fine", I think, and I try to help you.
                        
                        \*SEYTON pauses.\*
                        
                        SEYTON: And then, you go off the rails. You say whatever comes to mind. You do your own thing.
                        
                        \*SEYTON pauses.\*
                        
                        SEYTON: And you're really showcasing your A-Grade acting material here. You're really selling me on MACBETH's dilemma here.
                        
                        \*SEYTON pauses.\*

                        \*SEYTON pauses.\*
                        
                        SEYTON: Vast.

                        SEYTON: Bottomless.
                        
                        \*SEYTON pauses.\*
                        
                        SEYTON: Intelligence and Ability that you have available. So why don't you do me a favor, and...
                        
                        \*SEYTON pauses.\*
                        
                        SEYTON (Shouting): GET OFF THE STAGE!
                        
                        \*SEYTON drags MACBETH offstage. The DOCTOR and the SERVANT follow.\*
                **** MACBETH: Serves Macbeth right then. Guess I shouldn't've killed the King.
                    SEYTON: Yes, I guess he shouldn't've. Lesson learned.
                    
                    DOCTOR: But, I have my whole...
                    
                    SEYTON: Let's just move onto the next scene before things get worse.
                    
                    \*DOCTOR, SERVANT, and MACBETH exit.\*
        *** MACBETH: Sorry, say that again? I didn't catch all of that.
            SEYTON (Loudly Whispering): Are you kidding me?
            
            **** MACBETH: Don't worry, I'll make up a new motivation.
                SEYTON: What? Uhhh, no! Don't do that!
                
                ***** MACBETH: Macduff killed my father.
                ***** MACBETH: Macduff was the one who really killed the king!
            
                -----
                SEYTON: No! No he didn't! This didn't happen!
                
                \*MACBETH, DOCTOR, and SERVANT exit.\*
* MACBETH: I think that could do with some revision.
    \*MACDUFF leans out from stage left.\*
    MACDUFF (Whispering): Don't get fancy with it, just stick to the script.
    ** MACBETH: Ha, I didn't read the script.
        MACDUFF (Whispering): I am shocked. Shocked, that you cannot read.
        
        *** MACBETH: You don't have to be such a jerk, Macduff.
            MACDUFF: The way you phrase it, it's almost like I'm not your antagonist. Like I'm not meant to be the actual foil to your diabolical plans.
            
            **** MACBETH: Diabolical plans?
                MACDUFF: Diabolical, yes. You killed the king. You know what, I can't discuss this with you. I'll see you in a few scenes.
                
                \*MACDUFF yanks MACBETH offstage. The SERVANT and the DOCTOR follow.\*
            **** MACBETH: Alright, if you're my antagonist... GUARDS!
                MACDUFF: What?
                
                \*A few GUARDS enter, escorting MACDUFF onstage.\*
                ***** MACBETH: Schedule Macduff's execution.
                    MACDUFF: Wait a second, you can't do that.
                    
                    \*A GUARD grabs MACDUFF.\*
                    
                    MACDUFF: Hey, hold on, wait one second. This isn't in the script! I'm offstage! You can't...
                    
                    \*MACDUFF's cries grow quieter as they are dragged offstage.\*
                    
                    MACDUFF: Wait! I still need to do the next scene, you idiots!
                    
                    ****** MACBETH: Fine, but we're just going to execute you after that.
                        MACDUFF: Great. See you after.
                        
                        \*The GUARDS, MACDUFF, MACBETH, the SERVANT, and the DOCTOR exit.\*
                    ****** MACBETH: Sorry, no can do. I'll just replace you with an impostor.
                        \*FAKE MACBETH enters.\*
                        
                        FAKE MACBETH: I guess I'm Macduff now.
                        
                        (FAKE) MACDUFF: You can call me Macduff for this next scene.
                        
                        \*The GUARDS, MACDUFF, FAKE MACBETH (To be MACDUFF next scene), MACBETH, the SERVANT, and the DOCTOR exit.\*
                ***** MACBETH: I dunno, bind Macduff's hands together or something.
                    \*A GUARD binds MACDUFF's hands together.\*
                    
                    MACDUFF: Great. Now my hands are bound together. I'll see you in a bit.
                    
                    \*The GUARDS, MACDUFF, MACBETH, the SERVANT, and the DOCTOR exit.\*
        *** MACBETH: Wait, if I can't read, how can I read this?
            -> witch_encounter ->
    ** MACBETH: Stick with the script. Got it.
        MACDUFF (Whispering): Good.
        *** MACBETH: And that's why your honor, by habeas corpus, my client is completely innocent!
            MACDUFF (Whispering): What are you doing?
            
            PLAY DIRECTOR (Offstage): Is someone modifying the script?
            
            SEYTON (Offstage): It's Macbeth.
            
            MACDUFF (Whispering): You realize I have a law degree, right? And what you said is complete nonsense.
            
            PLAY DIRECTOR (Offstage): Okay, get the understudy back on.
            
            \*MACBETH is yanked offstage. The SERVANT and the DOCTOR follow.\*
        *** MACBETH: Wait, I still don't know the script.
            SEYTON (Whispering): I just fed you your lines!
            
            MACDUFF (Whispering): No revisions, stick to the script!
            
            **** MACBETH: But it's really hard to scroll all the way up and read whatever you said.
                SEYTON (Whispering): What are you talking about?
                
                MACDUFF (Whispering): Just say the line again so Macbeth can say it.
                
                SEYTON (Whispering): What?
                
                MACDUFF (Whispering): Can you speak up? I can't hear you.
                
                ***** MACBETH: Just both speak up at the same time!
                    SEYTON: I am TRYING to keep the illusion that we are professionals!
                    
                    \*SEYTON pauses.\*
                    
                    SEYTON: I mean, that you are still a professional! Because I certainly am one.
                    
                    MACDUFF (Whispering): Keep it down.
                    
                    SEYTON: WHAT? I can't HEAR you!
                    
                    MACDUFF (Whispering): Oh this is pointless.
                
                    SEYTON: I give up. Let's just skip to a scene where someone knows their lines!
                    
                    \*MACBETH is yanked offstage. The SERVANT and the DOCTOR follow.\*
                ***** MACBETH (Whispering): I can whisper too.
                    SEYTON (Whispering): [Unintelligble]
                    
                    MACDUFF (Whispering): [Unintelligble]

            **** MACBETH: But what if this is the script?
                SEYTON: Okay, I think we're done here. Macduff, you're up.
                
                \*MACBETH is forcefully moved offstage. The SERVANT and the DOCTOR follow.\*

FIRST WITCH: All hail Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of delusion!

SECOND WITCH: All hail Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of lies!

THIRD WITCH: Macbeth has already heard this part! Probably. Let's skip to the good stuff!

FIRST WITCH: We must call for a ritual!

SECOND WITCH: Yes a ritual! But what of the stage? What of Macbeth?

THIRD WITCH: Indeed, the AUDIENCE must not be kept waiting!

FIRST WITCH: Permit us to spirit you to safety! To bind your extremities, to unravel your orifices!

* MACBETH: What are you talking about?
* MACBETH: No way!
* MACBETH: I permit it.
    SECOND WITCH: HA! Macbeth permits us to... bind them.
    
    THIRD WITCH: Prepare the rope!
    
    FIRST WITCH: I call the legs!

SECOND WITCH: Macbeth rejects our gifts. Foolish, spiteful, scoliotic conduct.

THIRD WITCH: Fare thee well,

FIRST WITCH: We see you off!

SECOND WITCH: Remember: when all in slough,

THIRD WITCH: And the winds blow rough,

FIRST WITCH: Take great warning,

ALL: AND BEWARE MACDUFF!

\*FIRST WITCH, SECOND WITCH, and THIRD WITCH vanish. MACDUFF enters.\*

MACDUFF (Hurriedly Whispering): Why have you been staring at the stage for the past five minutes? We already had your understudy do the lines already...

\*MACBETH stares at the AUDIENCE. The AUDIENCE does not look particularly amused.\*

MACDUFF (Aggressively Whispering Through Clenched Teeth): GET. OFF. THE. STAGE.

\*MACBETH exits.\*
