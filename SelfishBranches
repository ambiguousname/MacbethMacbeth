\*SEYTON\* peers out from stage right.

SEYTON (Whispering): AHEM! Bring me no reports; let them fly all.

* MACBETH: What was that?
    SEYTON (Loudly Whispering): Bring me no reports! Let them fly all!
    ** MACBETH (Shouting): WHAT?
        SEYTON (Shouting): BRING ME NO REPORTS! LET THEM FLY ALL!
        *** MACBETH: Hey, keep it down!
            SEYTON (Shouting): HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ACTOR STRANGLE SOMEONE BEFORE?
            
            \*SEYTON turns to look offstage.\*
            
            SEYTON: What? WHAT? Macbeth started it!

            SERVANT: There is ten thousand--
            
            **** MACBETH: Ten thousand what?
                SERVANT: Geese. Wait, no... err...
                
                ***** MACBETH: Ten thousand geese?
                    SERVANT: No. Soldiers, sir!
                    ****** MACBETH: Is that how many soldiers I have?
                        SERVANT: Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
                        
                        ******* MACBETH: What did you just say to me?
                            SERVANT: Wait! WAIT! The English force, so please you.
                            
                            \*SEYTON enters from stage right, slowly clapping.\*
                            
                            SEYTON: Congrats, congrats! I have your armour here Sire, and LOOK, MACDUFF!

                        \*There is an uncomfortable silence as the SERVANT and MACBETH stare at each other for quite some time.\*
                        
                        DOCTOR: Ha, I am going to... leave now. And MACBETH will come with me to... check on things.

                    DOCTOR: Ha, yes! She is troubled with thick coming fancies,
                    That keep her from her rest.
                    
                    ****** MACBETH: Whatever you said makes no sense.
                        DOCTOR: Ha, very good. My good lord! Ha, your... royal preparation
                        Makes us hear something.

                        DOCTOR (Aside): Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
                        Profit again should hardly draw me here.
                        
                        \*DOCTOR rushes over to MACBETH to force them both offstage. SERVANT follows.\*
            
            **** \*MACBETH pauses to look at the SERVANT\*
                SERVANT: What are you... doing?

                        DOCTOR: I think sire Macbeth wishes no company. Let us depart.
                        
                        \*SERVANT exits. DOCTOR is about to exit, and turns to face MACBETH. MACBETH stares at DOCTOR silently.\*
                        
                        DOCTOR: Seyton shall be with your armour, lord. Ha, I shall do my best to cure my patient.
                        
                        \*The DOCTOR tugs MACBETH offstage.\*

                    \*MACBETH is hurriedly escorted offstage. FAKE MACBETH performs the rest of the scene, and exits with DOCTOR and SERVANT.\*
            **** MACBETH: Don't think we're not done, Seyton.
                SEYTON (Shouting): MACBETH! KEEP YOUR FLYING TRAP SHUT! THIS IS THE LAST STRAW!
                        
                    \*SEYTON marches on stage. PLAY DIRECTOR follows.\*
                    
                    PLAY DIRECTOR: Look, please don't make a scene...
                    
                    SEYTON: Oh, oh, I'M NOT MAKING A SCENE? WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?
                    
                    \*SEYTON gestures wildly at MACBETH.\*

                \*MACBETH begins to bow, and exits.\*
            **** MACBETH: Next line?
                SEYTON (Shouting): TILL BIRNAM WOOD REMOVE TO DUNSINANE,

    ** MACBETH: I mean, I can't understand what you're saying.
        SEYTON (Whispering): It means Macbeth doesn't want to hear any bad news!
        *** MACBETH: I get that, but... wait, why doesn't Macbeth want to hear any bad news?
                SEYTON (No longer whispering): Because he killed King Duncan, and he's now regretting the consequences of his actions!
                **** MACBETH: Wait, Macbeth's a murderer?
                    \*SEYTON steps onto the stage, and approaches MACBETH.\*

* MACBETH: I think that could do with some revision.
    \*MACDUFF leans out from stage left.\*
    MACDUFF (Whispering): Don't get fancy with it, just stick to the script.
    ** MACBETH: Ha, I didn't read the script.

\*FIRST WITCH, SECOND WITCH, and THIRD WITCH pop up from underneath the stage.\*
FIRST WITCH: All hail Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of delusion!

SECOND WITCH: All hail Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of lies!

THIRD WITCH: Macbeth has already heard this part! Probably. Let's skip to the good stuff!

FIRST WITCH: We must call for a ritual!

SECOND WITCH: Yes a ritual! But what of the stage? What of Macbeth?

THIRD WITCH: Indeed, the AUDIENCE must not be kept waiting!

FIRST WITCH: Permit us to spirit you to safety! To bind your extremities, to unravel your orifices!

* MACBETH: What are you talking about?
* MACBETH: No way!
* MACBETH: I permit it.
    SECOND WITCH: HA! Macbeth permits us to... bind them.
    
    THIRD WITCH: Prepare the rope!
    
    FIRST WITCH: I call the legs!
    
    \*FIRST WITCH, SECOND WITCH, and THIRD WITCH cackle gleefully, and begin to bind MACBETH.\*
    
    ALL: Show thy eyes, grieve thy heart;
    With your soul entwined, we so depart!
    
    FIRST WITCH: When you seek our host,
    take your path upmost!
    
    \*FIRST WITCH, SECOND WITCH, THIRD WITCH, and MACBETH exit.\*

SECOND WITCH: Macbeth rejects our gifts. Foolish, spiteful, scoliotic conduct.

THIRD WITCH: Fare thee well,

FIRST WITCH: We see you off!

SECOND WITCH: Remember: when all in slough,

THIRD WITCH: And the winds blow rough,

FIRST WITCH: Take great warning,

ALL: AND BEWARE MACDUFF!

\*FIRST WITCH, SECOND WITCH, and THIRD WITCH vanish. MACDUFF enters.\*

MACDUFF (Hurriedly Whispering): Why have you been staring at the stage for the past five minutes? We already had your understudy do the lines already...

\*MACBETH stares at the AUDIENCE. The AUDIENCE does not look particularly amused.\*

MACDUFF (Aggressively Whispering Through Clenched Teeth): GET. OFF. THE. STAGE.

\*MACBETH exits.\*
