\*SEYTON\* peers out from stage right.

SEYTON (Whispering): AHEM! Bring me no reports; let them fly all.

* MACBETH: What was that?
    SEYTON (Loudly Whispering): Bring me no reports! Let them fly all!
    ** MACBETH (Shouting): WHAT?
        SEYTON (Shouting): BRING ME NO REPORTS! LET THEM FLY ALL!
        *** MACBETH: Hey, keep it down!
            SEYTON (Shouting): HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ACTOR STRANGLE SOMEONE BEFORE?
            
            \*SEYTON turns to look offstage.\*
            
            SEYTON: What? WHAT? Macbeth started it!
            
            \*SERVANT clears their throat.\*
            
            SERVANT: There is ten thousand--
            
            **** MACBETH: Ten thousand what?
                SERVANT: Geese. Wait, no... err...
                
                ***** MACBETH: Ten thousand geese?
                    SERVANT: No. Soldiers, sir!
                    ****** MACBETH: Is that how many soldiers I have?
                        SERVANT: Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
                        
                        ******* MACBETH: What did you just say to me?
                            SERVANT: Wait! WAIT! The English force, so please you.
                            
                            \*SEYTON enters from stage right, slowly clapping.\*
                            
                            SEYTON: Congrats, congrats! I have your armour here Sire, and LOOK, MACDUFF!
                            \*MACBETH, SEYTON, DOCTOR, and SERVANT exit.\*
                        ******* MACBETH: My fear hath never been red.
                            SERVANT: Wait, wait, that's err... that's wrong.
                            It were, uhh, I mean... It is, it is good... no,
                            it's uhhh, it is bad... 
                            
                            \*The SERVANT's mumblings grow quieter and quieter.\*
                            
                            DOCTOR: Ha, your royal preparation is ready! Let us go!
                            
                            \*MACBETH, DOCTOR, and SERVANT exit.\*
                    ****** MACBETH: That's no good.
                        SERVANT: No. It's... not.
                        
                        \*There is an uncomfortable silence as the SERVANT and MACBETH stare at each other for quite some time.\*
                        
                        DOCTOR: Ha, I am going to... leave now. And MACBETH will come with me to... check on things.
                        
                        \*SERVANT, MACBETH, and DOCTOR exit.\*
                        
                ***** MACBETH: Wait, what happened to my sick wife?
                    DOCTOR: Ha, yes! She is troubled with thick coming fancies,
                    That keep her from her rest.
                    
                    ****** MACBETH: Whatever you said makes no sense.
                        DOCTOR: Ha, very good. My good lord! Ha, your... royal preparation
                        Makes us hear something.
                        
                        *******[MACBETH: I still am not making any sense of what you're saying.]
                        *******[MACBETH: I will make you unhear it.]
                        *******[MACBETH: I still don't know my lines.]
                        
                        -------
                        MACBETH: I--
                        
                        DOCTOR: HA YES, VERY GOOD! WERE I FROM DUNSINANE! I mean...
                        
                        DOCTOR (Aside): Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
                        Profit again should hardly draw me here.
                        
                        \*DOCTOR rushes over to MACBETH to force them both offstage. SERVANT follows.\*
            
            **** \*MACBETH pauses to look at the SERVANT\*
                SERVANT: What are you... doing?
                
                ***** \*MACBETH continues to stare.\*
                    SERVANT: Please... stop?
                    ****** MACBETH: IT WAS YOU!
                        SERVANT: What?
                        
                        \*The PLAY DIRECTOR enters.\*
                        
                        PLAY DIRECTOR: Uhm... Shock! Surprise! The SERVANT killed...
                        
                        ******* MACBETH: My wife! You poisoned my wife!
                            PLAY DIRECTOR: Sure, let's go with that.
                            
                            \*The PLAY DIRECTOR waits for a few seconds.\*
                            
                            PLAY DIRECTOR: AND so, MACBETH went offstage to... deal with the SERVANT!
                            
                            \*MACBETH, SERVANT, DOCTOR, and PLAY DIRECTOR exit.\*
                        ******* MACBETH: The king! You killed the poor king!
                            SERVANT: I killed the king?
                            
                            PLAY DIRECTOR: What? No!
                            
                            ******** \*MACBETH exits.\*
                            
                            PLAY DIRECTOR: Hey, wait a minute!
                            
                            \*SERVANT, DOCTOR, and PLAY DIRECTOR exit, chasing after MACBETH.\*
                    ****** MACBETH: No.
                        SERVANT: Please...?
                        
                        \*The DOCTOR quickly steps up to the SERVANT.\*
                        
                        DOCTOR: I think sire Macbeth wishes no company. Let us depart.
                        
                        \*SERVANT exits. DOCTOR is about to exit, and turns to face MACBETH. MACBETH stares at DOCTOR silently.\*
                        
                        DOCTOR: Seyton shall be with your armour, lord. Ha, I shall do my best to cure my patient.
                        
                        \*The DOCTOR tugs MACBETH offstage.\*
                ***** MACBETH: I don't know.
                    SERVANT: Okay... I feel like... I mean, I should probably...
                    
                    \*FAKE MACBETH peers out onstage.\*
                    
                    FAKE MACBETH: Alright, I'm gonna have a go. Excuse me, excuse me.
                    
                    \*MACBETH is hurriedly escorted offstage. FAKE MACBETH performs the rest of the scene, and exits with DOCTOR and SERVANT.\*
            **** MACBETH: Don't think we're not done, Seyton.
                SEYTON (Shouting): MACBETH! KEEP YOUR FLYING TRAP SHUT! THIS IS THE LAST STRAW!
                        
                    \*SEYTON marches on stage. PLAY DIRECTOR follows.\*
                    
                    PLAY DIRECTOR: Look, please don't make a scene...
                    
                    SEYTON: Oh, oh, I'M NOT MAKING A SCENE? WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS PURE MOCKERY?
                    
                    ***** MACBETH: Listen, I mean no disrespect...
                        SEYTON: Sure, like I believe you.
                        
                        \*PLAY DIRECTOR clears their throat.\*
                        
                        PLAY DIRECTOR: And yes, so MACBETH got into an argument with SEYTON, and MACBETH 'twere very sad.
                        
                        \*PLAY DIRECTOR escorts SEYTON, MACBETH, DOCTOR, and SERVANT offstage.\*
                    ***** MACBETH: Got something to say to me, Seyton?
                        SEYTON: Oh yeah, I've got two somethings you little...

        *** MACBETH: Ah, yes. Bring me no reports, let them fly all;
            **** MACBETH: Okay, that's it. See you all later!
                \*MACBETH begins to bow, and exits.\*
            **** MACBETH: Next line?
                SEYTON (Shouting): TILL BIRNAM WOOD REMOVE TO DUNSINANE,
                    ***** MACBETH: Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
                    ***** MACBETH: How many more lines am I going to have?
                        SEYTON (Shouting): TILL BIRNAM WOOD REMOVE TO DUNSINANE,
                        ****** MACBETH: Sorry, are you broken?

    ** MACBETH: I mean, I can't understand what you're saying.
        SEYTON (Whispering): It means Macbeth doesn't want to hear any bad news!
        *** MACBETH: I get that, but... wait, why doesn't Macbeth want to hear any bad news?
                SEYTON (No longer whispering): Because he killed King Duncan, and he's now regretting the consequences of his actions!
                **** MACBETH: Wait, Macbeth's a murderer?
                    \*SEYTON steps onto the stage, and approaches MACBETH.\*
                    SEYTON (Whispering to MACBETH): You are a thespian, right?
                    
                    \*SEYTON steps back and clears his throat.\*
